# Small Rust OS
This repository is an in-progress attempt of systematically designing and implementing
a small operating system using the Rust programming language.

## Quick Start
You can run the OS by running:

```
cargo run
```

We've extensively documented this project, including the motivations, necessary
background information, component and project specifications, and much more.
